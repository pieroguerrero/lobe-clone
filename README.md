## Clean Architecture
```
ðŸ“¦src => Main source code container
 â”£ ðŸ“‚assets => Media elements that are used in the page.
 â”£ ðŸ“‚components => Components that are used in multiple pages or layouts.
 â”£ ðŸ“‚configs => Configuration for the different components of the application.
 â”£ ðŸ“‚hooks =>Custom React Hooks to handle different functionalities or effects.
 â”£ ðŸ“‚layouts => Main layout components that give the general structure to the web site UI.
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚header
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚footer
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚skeleton
 â”£ ðŸ“‚pages => Components that generate the pages of the web site.
 â”£ ðŸ“‚tests => Files for testing.
 â”£ ðŸ“‚utilities => Functions that are common across the project.
```

## Optimization Techniques used:
- Lazy Loading for Images and Components with Lazy, Suspense and the react-lazy-load-image-component library.
- Font import optimization with .... font-display (swap) https://web.dev/optimize-webfont-loading/
- CDN ready for the files.. (I have to get the URL for the files in a function or component)
- Intersection Observer for the video playback.
- Video preload="metadata" to download some metadata before the full video is downloaded. With this the application will have some information ahead of time

## General Information
- This is a frontend project developed Rect with Typescript and Vite. The objectives are (1) be a playground for techniques that improve the performance of pages that use a large number of video and image elements and (2) be a placeholder for general React TS components I am using in real projects.


## Technologies and Techniques used
### Planning and Design:
- The duration of the project was 2.5 weeks.
- The planning was done with the [User Story Mapping](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story-mapping/) technique, you can fin the different Story Maps created in the corresponding [Features](#features) section below.
- The UI was ispired by the real [lobe.ai](download.pdf) website
- The Wireframes implemented and to be on this project were build in Figma and can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/MF42A0I66iqogQB7eyHW5F/LinkedIn-clone?node-id=2689%3A6000&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=2689%3A5984&starting-point-node-id=2689%3A6000). The Final UI was implemented using the official LinkedIn documentation about [Colors](https://brand.linkedin.com/content/brand/global/en_us/index/visual-identity/color-palettes) and [Typography](https://brand.linkedin.com/content/brand/global/en_us/index/visual-identity/typography).
- The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NhAYBe7IRGe9uUDRX6zaC4HNHDh6x8wA/view?usp=sharing).
- The internal project architecture was implemented following the concepts of the [CLEAN Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
- Overal code documentation was done leveraging [JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/).
- GitHub Actions was used to deploy the web.

### Front-end:
- ReactJS with a [customized CRA template](https://github.com/pieroguerrero/cra-template).
- Routing with [react-router v6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).
- Internal application state managed with [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/).
- CSS design with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 
- Code Splitting was implemented to reduce loading wating times. This was achieved using [Dynamic Import API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) and [React Lazy loading components](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy).
- The web app is 100% responsive.

### Testing:
- Unit testing was done.
- Test coverage is 45% and is increasing using Jest and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) is being used.
- While testing, the project was run using the Chrome's Development Tools "Fast 3G" and "No Caching" options. So the app is ready for slow internet connections.
- Lighhouse was executed several times, the last result objtained was 92% overal:
